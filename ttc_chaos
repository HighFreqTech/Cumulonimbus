different patterns in Mandroblt set. Patterns of internet traffic is chaotic. Laser, IC, nerve cell. 
Chaos shifts the focus from laws of nature to their consequences. Discovery of the laws is only a very small part of understanding nature.
Reductionism vs Holism. Newton's method of turning nonlinear gravity equation into linear one: u=1/r and use angle instead of distance.

Poncaire's problem seemed old fashioned. Birkhoff studied dynamic systems: first great American mathematician, mentor of Lorenz. 
Tom Stoppard's Arcadia - link to chaos.

Universality of logistic map. qualitative and quantitative universality. 
The U-sequence: occur in any map. 
Feigenbaum number: fundamental constants of chaos: 4.7 horizontally and 2.50 vertically, explained by renormalization group.

Real fractal: usu. 2 orders of magnitude. Scale symmetry.  
Fractal: irregularity in space. Chaos: irregularity in time.

Geoffrey West's biology laws: (1) 3/4 exponential energy/mass: 27 orders of magnitude. (2) 1/4 exponential heart beats/ breathes/ life span law. 
Sizes of capilary are similar.
Explanation: in larger animals, each capilary supplies more cells.
